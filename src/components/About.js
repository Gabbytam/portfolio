                   <p className='about-text'>
                   I am a full-stack developer who is driven by all there is for me to try, learn, and master. Software engineering is captivating to me because of its use of analysis and problem-solving, paired with creativity. I am equally intrigued by building a project from scratch as I am by the inevitable task of debugging because both offer a reason to be proud of your work. My work ethic has been greatly influenced by my experiences of studying under the pre-med track as well as growing up a competitive gymnast. The need for resiliency in both has shown itself in the work that I produce and who I am as an engineer. I have found satisfaction from being a developer and am eager to continue building upon my experience.

                <p className='about-text'>
                When I am not coding it is likely I am out hiking. I have also made a hobby out of weightlifting and on days where I chose non-physical activity, I turn to cross-stitching. As I am still young, I have used my time to try out life in different locations! In the past calendar year I have lived in Northern California, New York City, Seattle, and Honolulu. I have grown a passion for road tripping and along the way, gotten into landscape photography.
