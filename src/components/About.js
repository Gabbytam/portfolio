                   <h3>AS A DEVELOPER</h3>
                   <p className='about-text'>
                   I am a <b>full-stack developer</b> who is driven by all there is for me to try, learn, and master. Software engineering is captivating to me because of its use of <b>analysis</b> and <b>problem-solving</b>, paired with <b>creativity</b>. I am equally intrigued by building a project from scratch as I am by the inevitable task of debugging because both offer a reason to be proud of your work. My work ethic has been greatly influenced by my experiences of studying under the pre-med track as well as growing up a competitive gymnast. The need for <b>resiliency</b> in both has shown itself in the work that I produce and who I am as an engineer. I have found satisfaction from being a developer and am eager to continue building upon my experience.

                <h3>BESIDES DEVELOPING</h3>
                <p className='about-text'>
                When I am not coding it is likely I'm out <b>hiking</b>. I have also made a hobby out of strength training and on days where I chose non-physical activity, I turn to crafting. As I am still young, I have used my time to try out <b>life in different locations</b>! In the past calendar year I have lived in Northern California, New York City, Seattle, and Honolulu. I have grown a passion for <b>road tripping</b> and along the way, gotten into landscape <b>photography</b>.

                <p className='about-text'> 
                I hope to find a position where I can feel fulfilled and be proud of the work I produce for a company. I hope to spend the first few years getting hard coding experience under my belt and <b>expanding my knowledge</b> by learning from my team. Somewhere down the line I think I would really enjoy being a <b>Developer Advocate</b>.
